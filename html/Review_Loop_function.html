  <h1>Review Loop</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time. </li>
    <li>How to write for loops with an iterator variable that increments or decrements</li>
    <li>How to use a for loop to iterate through an array</li>
    <li>A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop</li>
    <li>while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions</li>
    <li>Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.</li>
    <li>do...while loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution</li>
    <li>The break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block</li>
  </ul>
